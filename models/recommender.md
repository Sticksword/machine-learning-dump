# all things recommender

usually split between candidate generation and candidate selection/ranking

candidate generation can be done through collaborative filtering mechanisms and/or matrix factorization (or through something like FAISS built by FB)

candidate ranking/selection can be done with any kind of model and some kind of probability output (higher the probability, the better)
